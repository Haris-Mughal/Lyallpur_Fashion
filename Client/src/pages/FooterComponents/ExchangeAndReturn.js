            <li>
              <strong>Conditions Qualified for Exchange:</strong>
              <br /> Articles are qualified for change only if they are unused,
              all tags are intact, packing is in its original condition and
              original invoice is present. Also, state a valid reason for

              wrong size, or incorrect. In case of home article exchange, it
              should be in Lyallpur Fashion’s original home packing. Similarly,
              with articles that are delivered in boxes such as the Unstitched
              Women’s collection, Menswear and semi-formal pieces that are

              <strong>Process of Online Exchange:</strong>
              <br /> It usually takes 7-10 days to complete the online exchange
              process after it has been verified. Instore exchanges require
              customers to have the original invoice and all the tags intact for
              the purchased article. If customers are dissatisfied with the item
              or have ordered and received the size that won’t fit them then
              they would be asked to drop off the purchased item at a given
              location. However, if the item is defected or incorrect then the
              article will be picked up from the customer’s doorstep.
